Your job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. For inspiration, check out this image from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628134444/http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/visual-hierarchy-compared.png">vanseodesign.com</a> which compares a site layout with no differentiation on the left to one with a thoughtful hierarchy on the right. Your final product will look much like the site on the right.

This is also an opportunity to get better at positioning <div> elements without worrying too much about whatâ€™s inside them, which will serve you well later.
